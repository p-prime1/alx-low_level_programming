prototype: void print_line(int n)
A for loop will be used
Declare i (i to be used as counter for the loop)
int n is the number passed to the function and determines the length of the line
In the for loop assign  0 to i then check if i < n if it is print _ (underscore)
write an if statement to check if n is equal to zero:
If n != 0 run the loop,
if the abpve statement is false then print new line (\n)
