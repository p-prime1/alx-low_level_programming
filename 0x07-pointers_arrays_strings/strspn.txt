The strspn function accept two arguments
strspn(char *s, char* accept)
*s is the main string
*accept is the string the main is to be measured against

The strspn function cmpares each char in the accept to the characters in s
When it find any char in s it adds it to the count 
It keeps counting until the doesnt find one and it returns the number of char counted
Or it reaches end of string

Process

Declare the neccesary header files
Declare two counters for the while loops
using two while loop
First while loop is for the accept string using i as the index
THe first condition used for the while loop is till the s string is not equal to '\0'
Second while loop is for the string to be searched to j to be used as index
The condition for the second loop compares each indexes of accept to s
And increments the conuter as required
Return the increment
