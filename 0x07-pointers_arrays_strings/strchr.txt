Write a function that searches for a character and returns a pointer to the 
occurence of the character

char *_strchr(char*s, char c)
S is the string to be searved 
and c is the character we are looking for

Using a loop to iterate through the srtring
In the loop we are checking for the null terminating char since we are working with a strinf
We use an if to check if ther char at a particular index matches the char
we are looking for
if it is we return the the pointer 
else we return null
